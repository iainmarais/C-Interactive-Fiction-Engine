C# Interactive Fiction Engine 

It currently consists of a working Command-line interpreter, Object, Location and Scene datasets. 
I will update this description as I finish work on fleshing out the other parts of the engine.

The objective of this project is an interactive fiction engine entirely coded in C#.

The inspiration behind the project is old-school IF games like the text-only era Zork games.
